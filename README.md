A local, single-user web UI for **[beads](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads)**
(`bd`) — Steve Yegge's distributed graph issue tracker. beads ships a powerful CLI
but no interactive visualizer that also lets you *create* work. This app is that
visualizer: a fast, graph-aware task board for humans, on top of a tracker built
for AI agents.

## Features

- **Board** — a five-column view (Backlog · Ready · In Progress · Blocked · Done)
  with dense cards showing id, type, priority, assignee, dep/comment counts, and an
  origin badge. Filter by type / priority / origin, full-text search, and a
  show/hide-archived toggle. Keyboard: `n` new, `/` search, `Esc` close.
- **Backlog ↔ Ready drag-and-drop** — drag cards between columns to change status
  (Backlog = `deferred`, Done = `bd close`); updates are optimistic.
- **Create / edit** — add tasks and epics (type, priority, description, assignee,
  labels, parent epic, start-in-backlog) and edit status/priority inline.
- **Epics & progress** — epics with live `closed ÷ children` progress bars and
  expandable child lists; add a child straight into an epic.
- **Dependencies & graph** — view/add/remove typed dependencies in the detail
  drawer, plus an interactive React Flow dependency graph (drag node→node to link).
- **Comments** — author-stamped comment threads with a composer on every bead.
- **Archive & delete** — archive (reversible `bd close` + `archived` label) or
  delete (`bd delete`, behind a confirm).
- **Human-vs-agent attribution** — every bead and comment shows 👤 (human) or 🤖
  (agent), derived from a configurable human allowlist.
- **Settings** — repo path, human actor + allowlist, poll interval, and light/dark
  theme. Live polling keeps the board fresh when agents change data underneath you.

## How it works

- **beads has no HTTP API**, so the app shells out to the `bd` CLI
  (`bd … --json`, `BD_JSON_ENVELOPE=1`). `bd` stays the single source of truth —
  the app adds **zero** new persisted schema. The only adapter is
  [`lib/bd.ts`](lib/bd.ts); see the spec in [`design/design.md`](design/design.md).
- The UI was designed in **Claude Design** and rebuilt faithfully here with
  Next.js + shadcn/Tailwind. The original export and a screen/token map live in
  [`design/ui-export/`](design/ui-export/).

### Backlog & attribution (design decisions)
- **Backlog** maps to beads' built-in `deferred` status; **Ready** = open &
  unblocked. Dragging between columns runs `bd update --status` / `bd close`.
- beads has no human-vs-agent flag, so the UI stamps its own writes with a
  configured **human actor** (`BEADS_ACTOR`); anyone in the human allowlist renders
  as 👤, everyone else as 🤖. **Archive** = `bd close` + an `archived` label
  (reversible); **Delete** = `bd delete`.

## Run it

**Prerequisites:** Node 20+ and npm. For live mode you also need the
[`bd`](https://github.com/gastownhall/beads) binary on your `PATH` and a `.beads`
repo (`bd init`). No `bd`? The app falls back to demo mode automatically.

```bash
npm install
npm run dev            # http://localhost:3000
```

- **With real data:** run from (or point Settings at) a directory containing a
  `.beads` repo, with `bd` on your `PATH`. Override the repo with
  `BEADS_REPO=/path/to/project` and the binary with `BD_BIN=/path/to/bd`.
- **Durable production launch:** `npm run build && npm run serve` runs the
  supervised launcher ([`scripts/serve.mjs`](scripts/serve.mjs)), which also
  restarts the server when the in-app "Update now" button requests it. It
  auto-loads [`scripts/federation.env`](scripts/federation.env), a committed
  defaults file setting `BD_BIN`, `BEADS_DIR`, `BD_JSON_ENVELOPE=1`, and
  `HOST=0.0.0.0` — so a crash, restart, or self-update relaunch can never
  silently lose these and fall back to a broken `bd`. This matters because on
  some machines `bd` on `PATH` is a *federation wrapper* that routes between
  multiple issue stores: run with no store context, it just prints a
  store-selection menu and does nothing — `BD_BIN` must point at the real,
  single-store `beads` binary instead. Any of these already set in your shell
  environment overrides the file, so other machines/users aren't stuck with
  the committed defaults.
- **Demo mode:** if `bd` isn't installed (or you set `BEADS_DEMO=1`), the app runs
  against an in-memory dataset seeded from the design export — so you can explore
  every feature without beads. The sidebar shows which mode is active.
- **Installing as a PWA:** the app ships a manifest, icons, and a service worker,
  but installability also requires HTTPS (or `localhost`) — browsers won't offer
  the install prompt over a plain-HTTP Tailscale address like `http://100.x.y.z`
  or `http://machine.tailnet.ts.net` even though the manifest/service worker are
  present. Serve over HTTPS instead: run `tailscale cert
  <your-machine>.<tailnet>.ts.net` and point `npm run serve` at that certificate,
  or use Tailscale Serve/Funnel in front of it.

Set the human actor / allowlist, repo path, and theme in **Settings** (stored
under your OS config dir, not in beads).

### Docker

```bash
docker build -t bead-me-up-scotty .
docker run -p 3000:3000 bead-me-up-scotty      # → http://localhost:3000
```

> The build runs `npm ci`, which needs the committed `package-lock.json` for
> reproducible installs. The lockfile is tracked in the repo (a `.gitignore`
> negation keeps it that way even if your global gitignore excludes lockfiles),
> so a clean clone builds without a prior `npm install`.

The image includes the `bd` CLI, so real data works out of the box — just
mount your project directory and point `BEADS_REPO` at it:

```bash
BEADS_REPO=/path/to/project
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  --name beads_ui \
  -v $BEADS_REPO:/data \
  -e BEADS_REPO=/data \
  bead-me-up-scotty
```

The container runs as a non-root `nextjs` user with `HOME=/home/nextjs` and
`XDG_CONFIG_HOME=/home/nextjs/.config`, so `bd` and app settings have a valid
runtime config directory. On Linux, if `bd` fails with permission errors writing
to the mounted `.beads` directory, run as your host user: `--user $(id -u):$(id -g)`
(the config dirs are world-writable, so settings keep working). Settings live
inside the container, so they are lost when it is recreated — bind-mount the
config dir to keep them:

```bash
-v "$HOME/.config/bead-me-up-scotty:/home/nextjs/.config/bead-me-up-scotty"
```

Container limitations:

- The image has no `git`, so Dolt remote sync (`refs/dolt/data`) and `bd init`
  don't work inside it — run those on the host. UI edits (create/update/close)
  work fine; they just won't auto-push until you sync from the host.
- **Refine with AI** shells out to the Claude Code CLI, which isn't bundled;
  the button shows an error in the container.
- The bundled `bd` version is pinned in the Dockerfile (`ARG BD_VERSION`);
  override with `--build-arg BD_VERSION=<version>` to match your host.

## Install globally

Install once from a clone, then run `scotty` (or `bead-me-up-scotty`) from **any**
directory. It starts the production server on a free port (default 3000) and opens
your browser. Run it from a folder that has a `.beads` repo to jump straight to
that project; otherwise you get the project picker. Requires Node 20+.

Flags: `-p, --port <n>` · `--no-open` · `--help`.

**Recommended — `npm link` (keep the clone):**

```bash
git clone <repo-url> bead-me-up-scotty
cd bead-me-up-scotty
npm install
npm run build
npm link
scotty                 # from anywhere
```

The global command is a symlink to the clone, so keep it on disk and re-run
`npm run build` after pulling changes. Uninstall: `npm rm -g bead-me-up-scotty`.

**Alternative — global copy (clone is deletable):**

```bash
git clone <repo-url> bead-me-up-scotty
cd bead-me-up-scotty
npm install
rm -rf .next           # ensure a clean build (only the prod build is shipped)
npm run build
npm install -g .
scotty                 # from anywhere; the clone can now be deleted
```

To update, rebuild and re-run `npm install -g .`. If `npm install -g .` hits a
permissions error, use a user-owned npm prefix:
`npm config set prefix ~/.npm-global` and add `~/.npm-global/bin` to your `PATH`.
